    "thingiverse_description": "I got my hands on a Tomlov DM602 digital microscope recently. HavenÂ´t had the time to use it extensively for soldering so far but especially the flex arm makes it a real eye candy on my desk. I designed a simple cable tunnel for the flex arm to improve the cable management and make it look even better and cleaner. Due to the limited printing area in Z-Direction I split it up into two parts per segment. You might want to adjust the Z-Axis and scale/split it up it for your demands.",
